My second emulator in Golang. The Nintendo Entertainment System

## About
This a project that's been done many times before but in the realm of aspiriational for me. Good excuse to get more comfortable with Golang and with thinking about programming closer to the metal. Hopefully this'll end up running with gomobile.
